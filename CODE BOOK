## Introduction

The tidy data set, `tidy_data.txt`, contains averages of the mean and standard deviation measurements for each activity and each subject from the original Human Activity Recognition data.

## Variables

The tidy data set consists of the following variables:

- `subject`: Identifier for the subject who performed the activity (ranges from 1 to 30).
- `activity`: Descriptive name of the activity performed by the subject.
- Other variables: The average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For a complete list of variables and their descriptions, refer to the [features_info.txt](./data/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset/features_info.txt) file in the original data.

## Transformation

The tidy data set is created by merging, cleaning, and summarizing the original data using the `run_analysis.R` script. The script performs the following steps:

1. Downloads and unzips the raw data.
2. Reads and merges the training and test datasets, labels, and subjects.
3. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation measurements.
4. Applies descriptive activity names.
5. Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
6. Creates a tidy data set with averages for each activity and each subject.

## How to Read Tidy Data

To read the tidy data back into R, you can use the following R code:

```R
tidy_data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE)
